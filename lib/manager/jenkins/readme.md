The Jenkins manager supports a custom text or yaml format of the plugin list as described [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool#plugin-input-format). Currently, only versions from the main [update center](https://updates.jenkins.io/) are supported.

There's no strict specification on the name of the files, but usually it's `plugins.txt` or `plugins.yaml`.
